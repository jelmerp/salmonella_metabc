	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {Comparing ecological communities across environmental gradients can be challenging, especially when the number of different taxonomic groups in the communities is large. In this setting, community-level summaries called diversity indices are widely used to detect changes in the community ecology. However, estimation of diversity indices has received relatively little attention from the statistical community. The most common estimates of diversity are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a multinomial model, even though the multinomial model implies strict assumptions about the sampling mechanism. In particular, the multinomial model prohibits ecological networks, where taxa positively and negatively co-occur. In this article, we leverage models from the compositional data literature that explicitly account for co-occurrence networks and use them to estimate diversity. Instead of proposing new diversity indices, we estimate popular diversity indices under these models. While the methodology is general, we illustrate the approach for the estimation of the Shannon, Simpson, Bray–Curtis, and Euclidean diversity indices. We contrast our method to multinomial, low-rank, and nonparametric methods for estimating diversity indices. Under simulation, we find that the greatest gains of the method are in strongly networked communities with many taxa. Therefore, to illustrate the method, we analyze the microbiome of seafloor basalts based on a 16S amplicon sequencing dataset with 1425 taxa and 12 communities.},

This allows us to predict the unobserved count and hence estimate the total diversity. We believe that this is the first approach to depart from the classical mixed Poisson model in this problem. Our method is geometrically intuitive and yields good fits to data with reasonable standard errors. It is especially well-suited to analyzing high diversity datasets derived from next-generation sequencing in microbial ecology. We demonstrate the method's performance in this context and via simulation, and we present a dataset for which our method outperforms all competitors.},

	abstract = {Identifying differentially abundant microbes is a common goal of microbiome studies. Multiple methods have been applied for this purpose, which are largely used interchangeably in the literature. Although it has been observed that these tools can produce different results, there have been very few large-scale comparisons to describe the scale and significance of these differences. In addition, it is challenging for microbiome researchers to know which differential abundance tools are appropriate for their study and how these tools compare to one another. Here, we have investigated these questions by analyzing 38 16S rRNA gene datasets with two sample groups for differential abundance testing. We tested for differences in amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomic units (referred to as ASVs for simplicity) between these groups with 14 commonly used differential abundance tools. Our findings confirmed that these tools identified drastically different numbers and sets of significant ASVs, however, for many tools the number of features identified correlated with aspects of the tested study data, such as sample size, sequencing depth, and effect size of community differences. We also found that the ASVs identified by each method were dependent on whether the abundance tables were prevalence-filtered before testing. ALDEx2 and ANCOM produced the most consistent results across studies and agreed best with the intersect of results from different approaches. In contrast, several methods, such as LEfSe, limma voom, and edgeR, produced inconsistent results and in some cases were unable to control the false discovery rate. In addition to these observations, we were unable to find supporting evidence for a recent recommendation that limma voom, corncob, and DESeq2 are more reliable overall compared with other methods. Although ALDEx2 and ANCOM are two promising conservative methods, we argue that those researchers requiring more sensitive methods should use a consensus approach based on multiple differential abundance methods to help ensure robust biological interpretations.},
